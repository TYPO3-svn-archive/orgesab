Default: The editor has access to most fields. None excluded: The editor has access to all fields like the administrator. All excluded: the editor has access to required fields only like the title.

If you have a website without a fe_user administration, you don't need the fe_group controlling field in backend forms. This option marks it in organiser tables 'excluded'. This has an effect for editors and it hasn't any effect for administrators.

  # cat=organiser/enable/930;             type=options[Easy 1: all in the same directory,Easy 2: same as easy 1 but with storage pid,Clear presented: each record group in one directory at most,Multi grouped: record groups in different directories]; label=Store record configuration: [Easy]: less configuration costs. If you want to link from one record to another, both have to be stored in the same directory. It may be confusing in case of a lot of data. [Clear presented]: each record group has its own directory. I.e. fe_users are in [staff], events are in [calendar]. Disadvantage: you have to configure page TSconfig and you will have some wizards without an add icon and without an list icon. [Multi grouped]: Same like [clear presented], but record groups can have more than one directory. It enables sophisticated access rules. See section "FAQ: Store record configuration" in the manual. 
store_records = Easy 1: all in the same directory
   # cat=organiser/enable/931;            type=options[Yes (recommended),No]; label=Full wizard support: If full wizard support is enabled, main records will have all three icons for their category records: edit, add and list. This is best usability. But you have to store category records in the same directory like the main records. You have to rough it, if there are needs to store categories in other directories. This property has only an effect in case of store records [clear presented] or [multi grouped].
full_wizardSupport = Yes (recommended)
